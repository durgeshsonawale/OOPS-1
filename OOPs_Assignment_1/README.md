# Data Flow

## Classes Section
-   *This section contains a Car class and 3 different classes for different car types.* :

* ### Cars Class
    - This class contains all necessary data types and methods which will be used by its child classes for functioning. 

    - One such method is **generateBill(String []Codes)** : This method takes array of codes as parameter and uses those codes to determine the bill of the user.


* ### Main Class
    - Here we take the input from user as to which car and what services to that car he wants. And after the respective car object is created and the bill is generated.


## Database Design
- *This program uses basic integer variables and a HashMap of Strings to store data. The data is not persistent in the program i.e., as soon as the program is terminated the data is lost.*

## Summary

*This project demonstrates various OOPs concepts like **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism** etc*.

*This is coded in **Java** language.*
